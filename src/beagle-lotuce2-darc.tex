The Durham adaptive Optics Real Time Controller (DARC)\cite{basden2010durham} is a real-time system
for astronomical adaptive optics systems originally developed at Durham
University and in use for the CANARY instrument. One of its main strengths is
to be a generic and high performance real-time controller running on a
off-the-shelf Linux computer. DARC is an open-source project. We are using DARC
for two different implementations: BEAGLE, a Multi-Object AO (MOAO) bench
system to experiment with novel tomographic reconstructors and LOTUCE2, an
in-dome turbulence instrument. We present the software architecture for each
application, current benchmarks and lessons learned for current and future DARC

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section
The Durham adaptive Optics Real Time Controller (DARC) is a real-time system
for astronomical adaptive optics systems originally developed at Durham
University and in use for the CANARY instrument. One of its main strengths is
to be a generic and high performance real-time controller running on a
off-the-shelf Linux computer. It was developed in a modular way making it
flexible enough to simple or sophisticated AO instruments. Very importantly,
DARC is an open-source project. Taking advantage of it modularization degree,
it is possible to implement different AO algorithms as well as different pieces
of hardware, such as cameras for wavefront sensors (WFS) and deformable
mirrors. As it is a standard Linux application, it is possible to take
advantage of external components which can be interfaced in Linux, such as
Firewire or GigE cameras. For new components, it is always possible to build a
Linux driver and Application Program Interface that can control the device.
DARC uses current multi-core technologies efficiently, performing at speeds
that were only possible to achieve with complex architectures in the past\cite{basden2012durham}. 
We are using DARC for two different implementations: BEAGLE and LOTUCE2. BEAGLE
(presented elsewhere at this conference) is a Multi-Object AO (MOAO) bench
system to experiment with novel tomographic reconstructors, such as Artificial
Neural Networks. For BEAGLE we have developed a new module within DARC, which
runs the bench in ``multiple WFS'' mode, by controlling a constellation of light
sources, three phase plates mechanisms and only one WFS camera. DARC runs this
system in conjunction with a Single Board Computer which is in charge of some
of the hardware components. LOTUCE2 (presented elsewhere at this conference) is
an in-dome turbulence instrument, which measures the angle-of-arrival of
multiple lasers to individual high-speed cameras. DARC has been used to run
four cameras, which have in-sync hardware trigger. DARC processes the pixel
streams, obtaining the angle-of-arrival from each camera, saving data to disk
and performing various analysis in real-time. We present the software
architecture for each application, current benchmarks and lessons learned for
current and future DARC developers.

\subsection{BEAGLE}
BEAGLE is a Multi-Object AO (MOAO) bench that can emulate the optical
characteristics of the William Hershel Telescope, it has two motorized phase
plates which allow change the position of the plate scale. DARC, a real-time
system for astronomical adaptive optics systems, is beeing used to control
acquisition images. Extra development was necessary integrate specific hardware
devices component which represents phase plate movement and guide stars. The
main features which DARC provides and BEAGLE uses are the centroid calculation
in real-time\cite{basden2012wavefront}, and camera control for Firewire
protocol. It was pending create such a way to controls new peripherals involved
to make BEAGLE works. Toward that objective, a single board computer was used.
The selected single board computer was a BeagleBone Back (BBB). The challenge
of integrating DARC with new the single board computer was relative simple, and
relays on a local area network (TCP/IP connectivity) and scripting language
glue. 


\subsection{Lotuce2}
Lotuce (LOcal Turbulence Experiement)\cite{ziad1a2013lotuce} is an experimental
concept to mesure and characterized the optical-turbulence inside a telescope
enclosureor has been developed\cite{berdja1afirst}. LOTUCE2 is an upgraded
prototype whose main aim is to measure optical turbulence characteristics more
precisely by minimising cross-contamination of signals. This characterisation
is both quantitative (optical turbulence strength) and qualitative (assessing
the optical turbulence statistical model).
